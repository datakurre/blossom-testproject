This project shows how to start using Blossom with a new project.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Node.js (http://nodejs.org). You'll want version 0.6.x (where 'x' is any number).
3. From within the blossom-testproject directory, do `npm install blossom`.

With those three steps done, from within the blossom-testproject directory, 
do: `node projectfile.js`.

You can then visit http://localhost:4020/app. You should see a red square 
rendered to the screen.

Examine projectfile.js to see how the app is defined and the blossom 
framework that you installed via `npm` is used.
